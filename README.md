# Hi there, I'm Marcel Pulido ðŸ‘‹

## Java Backend Developer | Spring Boot & Angular | GenAI Enthusiast

I'm a passionate software developer specializing in backend development with Spring Boot. I began my journey studying software engineering in Cuba before moving to the U.S., where I've been advancing my skills through self-study, professional certifications, and building production-ready applications.

### ðŸš€ What Drives Me

I'm drawn to backend development because it challenges me to think deeply about system architecture, data flow, and business logic. I love working with Spring Boot for its robustness and versatility in building enterprise applications. The complexity of solving real business problems through elegant code design is what gets me excited every day.
